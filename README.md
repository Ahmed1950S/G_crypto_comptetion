# G_crypto_comptetion

in this notebook, I will use fastai's Tsai, a timeSeries library to analyse btc data from G_research kaggle competition 

I uploaded the notebook without the data due to the file seize but you can obtain the data buy running the following command. 

kaggle competitions download -c g-research-crypto-forecasting.

Hope someone finds this useful.
